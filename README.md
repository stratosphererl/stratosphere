## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Designed to help players improve their gameplay performance, Stratosphere is an analytics platform for the competitive car-soccer video game Rocket League. With its intuitive website and in-game overlay mod, Stratosphere provides players with comprehensive match analytics and machine-learned insights. By uploading match data generated by Rocket League, players can access a wealth of statistics, such as team comparisons, positioning heatmaps, goal-shot ratio, and more. We utilized a microservices architecture in our development for greater flexibility and scalability. Our frontend was developed with React and C++. Our backend was developed using Apollo GraphQL as its API gateway, Docker for deployment and infrastructure, and RESTful services using FastAPI with PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data persistence.
