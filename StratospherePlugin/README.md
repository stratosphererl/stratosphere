# Stratosphere Overlay Plugin

## Building

You gots to haves the visually studios of 2019 or better!

Open up dat gawd damned solution! Should be lookin like StratospherePlugin.sln

If future steps be goin' downhill, try retargeting the solution by clicking on the project tab!

If you wanna build dat solution, click build->build StratospherePlugin or hit shift+f6 or maybe shift+b, idk it's different for everyone it seems!

You did it my guy! Have fun (jk, c++ is never fun)
